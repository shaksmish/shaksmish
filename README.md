### Hi there 👋

👩🏻‍💼 I'm a self-taught Front-end Developer based out of the Netherlands.

🌱 I’m currently learning React and React Native to help build meaningful web apps.

🔭 I’m currently working on building a 🐶 Pet Adoption project using React.

💬 Ask me about my journey in learning HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Tailwind CSS, Netlify and more. 

📝 I am also documenting my front-end learning path and will share it soon.
